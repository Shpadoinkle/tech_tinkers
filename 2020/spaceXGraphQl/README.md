# Api Playground:

Built a simple react app that queries the public spaceX api at https://api.spacex.land/graphql/ for a list of Rocket types and the next upcoming launch.

**Tech Stack Used**

- React with Typescript
- Apollo Client for Graphql query

**Deployment**

Deployed using firebase hosting, as it is quick and easy. Live Deployment of this app can be found here at [https://thoash-spacex.firebaseapp.com/](https://thoash-spacex.firebaseapp.com/)

**Technical Challenges**

- As design isn't really my strong suit, I used this app as a chance to experiement a bit more with matieral-ui. Hence the basic look and feel.

Examples of following a design whilst building my own custom components can be found in some some of my older repos.
An example is this app which pulls data from the Pokemon api for party building. https://github.com/Shpadoinkle/pokemonv2
