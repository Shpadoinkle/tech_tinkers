Movie app using the https://api.themoviedb.org api.

Itegrates trending and search apis as well as single movie query.

This can be viewed at [my firebase project](https://thoash-moviedb.firebaseapp.com)

This is an older project from my days using Redux-Thunk for state management.
Note this is an older project and doesnt compile with later version of node. Switching to node v8.0.0 (npm v5.0.0) allowed it to compile.
