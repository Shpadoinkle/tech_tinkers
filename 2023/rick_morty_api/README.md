## Rick and Morty graphql playground
- Felt like playground with some of the free graphql libraries. 
#### Update - abandoned
- Had some intital ideas for this as the GraphQL documentation listed data like dimension origins etc..
    - ie.. rarities/groupings of cards etc based on dimensions
- but majority of this data was either null or generic information that didnt separate characters in any useful way.
- Lost interest due to data limitations
